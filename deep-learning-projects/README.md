# Deep Learning Projects

This folder contains university projects focused on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for computer vision tasks.  
The projects are related and build progressively from **custom CNN design** to **transfer learning and fine-tuning**.

### 1. Age Estimator (CNN from Scratch)

A complete end-to-end deep learning project where multiple CNN architectures were designed, trained, and evaluated **from scratch** for:

- **Regression**: age estimation from facial images  
- **Classification**: age group prediction

The project explores a wide range of architectural and training variations, including:
- Network depth
- Activation functions
- Kernel sizes
- Skip connections
- Data augmentation
- Channel reduction (RGB → grayscale)

Best-performing models are selected based on test metrics and compared against baseline architectures.

### 2. Backbone Model and Fine-Tuning

A continuation of the previous project, focusing on:
- Using **pretrained CNN backbones**
- Feature extraction vs full fine-tuning
- Comparing transfer learning strategies against custom CNNs

This project investigates how pretrained representations impact performance and convergence compared to models trained from scratch.
