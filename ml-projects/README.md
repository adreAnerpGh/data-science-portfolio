# Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains **end-to-end machine learning projects** developed as part of university coursework and independent study.  
The projects focus on applying **core machine learning concepts** to real-world datasets, with an emphasis on **sound methodology, evaluation, and interpretation** rather than production deployment.

Across these projects, the workflow typically includes:
- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering and encoding  
- Model training and comparison  
- Handling of class imbalance and evaluation beyond accuracy  
- Interpretation of results and discussion of limitations  

The notebooks are designed to be **self-contained and reproducible**, and reflect an **academic and exploratory approach** to machine learning, highlighting trade-offs between model complexity, performance, and generalisation.

- Binary classification task predicting customer response to a marketing campaign  
- Comparison of multiple models under strong class imbalance  
- Follow-up notebook showcasing a focused **XGBoost pipeline**  
- Emphasis on recall, precision, F1 score, and ROC-AUC
