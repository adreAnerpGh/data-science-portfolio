# U.S. Presidential Elections Dataset (1976–2024) Analysis

This project explores historical and recent (at the time of this work) U.S. presidential election data, focusing on voter turnout and state-level differences. 

The analysis highlights trends and patterns over time using **data cleaning, transformation, and visualization**.  

The project demonstrates a clear approach to working with real-world datasets, emphasizing both preparation and insight, rather than aiming for a production-ready pipeline.
