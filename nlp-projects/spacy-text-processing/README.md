# Spacy Text Processing

This project performs text processing on a synthetic dataset of news articles. It includes generating documents with Ollama LLM, extracting Named Entities using spaCy, computing embeddings (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, GloVe), and running similarity searches with queries. All generated files are stored in this folder.  

**Note:** The GloVe embeddings file `glove.6B.100d.txt` is **not included** in this repository. You can download it from [Stanford NLP GloVe](https://downloads.cs.stanford.edu/nlp/data/glove.6B.zip).  

Scripts in this folder cover the full workflow: generating synthetic documents, analyzing Named Entities, creating queries, and computing similarity baselines using different embedding methods.
