# Natural Language Processing & AI Projects

This folder contains university projects focused on applied Natural Language Processing, ranging from classical linguistic analysis to modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems built around large language models.

The projects are independent but complementary: one focuses on **foundational NLP techniques**, while the other applies **LLMs, vector search, and agentive workflows** to structured data.

## Text Processing with spaCy (University Project)

This project focuses on core NLP preprocessing and linguistic analysis using spaCy.  
It covers tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and similarity analysis, with an emphasis on reproducible text processing pipelines.

## RAG-Based Agentive AI System (University Project)

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying structured medical data using a local LLM.  
It combines vector search (FAISS), numeric analysis, and free-text reasoning, with both basic and advanced agentive query workflows exposed through a Streamlit interface.
