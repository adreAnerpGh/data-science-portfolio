# RAG Agentive AI - Medical Data Assistant

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** with an **agentive workflow** for querying medical datasets.  

The app allows users to interact with patient data using a local LLM and choose between:

- **Numeric analysis:** Compute averages, sums, min/max, correlations, or counts for selected columns.  
- **Free-text RAG queries:** Retrieve relevant dataset rows and get concise answers generated by the LLM.  

The system supports an **advanced mode** with multi-turn conversation context and a **basic mode** for single free-text queries.

## Key Dependencies

- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/):** Web interface for interactive queries.  
- **[FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss):** Vectorstore for efficient similarity search.  
- **[Ollama LLM](https://ollama.com/):** Local language model for query answering and summarization.  

## Running the App

After cloning the repository:

```bash
cd <repo-folder>
streamlit run rag-agentive-ai/app_streamlit.py
