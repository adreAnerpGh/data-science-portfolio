# U.S. Presidential Elections Dataset (1976–2024) Analysis

This project explores historical and recent (at the time of this work) U.S. presidential election data, focusing on voter turnout and state-level differences. The analysis highlights trends and patterns over time using **data cleaning, transformation, and visualization**.  

The datasets provide a rich context for examining how turnout has evolved across elections and states, making it a compelling case for exploring structured election data. All outputs are included, so the results can be viewed on GitHub without re-running the code.  

The project demonstrates a clear approach to working with real-world datasets, emphasizing both preparation and insight, rather than aiming for a production-ready pipeline.
