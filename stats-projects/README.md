# Statistical Analysis Projects

This repository contains four applied statistical analysis projects using real-world datasets, developed for academic coursework and portfolio demonstration.

## Projects

### 1. Football Salaries (2023–24): Correlation, ANOVA & Hypothesis Testing  
Exploratory statistical analysis of professional football salaries.  
Methods include correlation analysis, t-tests, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests to examine relationships between salary, reputation, age, nationality, and league status.

### 2. Football Salaries: Binary Logistic Regression  
Logistic regression used to model the probability of a player belonging to a high-salary group based on demographic, performance, and league-related predictors.

### 3. Football Salaries: Multiple Linear Regression  
Multiple linear regression applied to log-transformed salaries to quantify the impact of reputation, age, experience, nationality, and league characteristics, with full model diagnostics.

### 4. Website Satisfaction Survey: Dimension Reduction  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation applied to a 17-item satisfaction survey.  
Four latent dimensions were identified (typography, color, interactivity, navigation), explaining ~77% of total variance, followed by reliability analysis using Cronbach’s alpha.
